## **Inspiration**
In our current society, we recognize that financial literacy is often a privilege rather than a right. Many individuals and even communities as a whole lack access to trusted supported and education for investment knowledge. In addition, the complexity of financial markets can be intimidating, leaving many to fear how to even start learning. Just as information was democratized in our society with WiFi, Diversifile, aims to provide easy access for users to begin their journeys and learning personalized investments strategies. Regardless of background or experience, Diversifile was created to teach and spread diversity in investments and in life.

## **What it Does**
Our platform uses a multitude of tools to provide a service that provides real-time financial data and analysis easily. By leveraging MATLAB, the website is able to both extract the real-time data and generate easy-to-read candlestick graphs along with common patterns and trends. With this financial data, Diversifile will assign a risk rating, giving users confidence in their decisions. Along with real-time data analysis, Diversifile is also a service that empowers individuals by providing tools specifically and specially prepared for the user. After a short quiz, information like personality, willingness to take risks and financial data will be connected with the account allowing for highly personalized education and suggestions.

## **How We Built It**
We built Diversifile from scratch, utilizing Next.js and Tailwind CSS for our frontend design and MongoDB Atlas to power our backend database. MATLAB was used to generate data of various publicly traded companies and analyze their respective historical candlestick patterns to display on our platform. Auth0 was implemented to create a user account system within the platform. On top of our principal program, we built a Adobe Express add-on using their JavaScript package to allow users to import our generated candlestick patterns onto different forms of media with ease on Adobe Express.

## **Challenges We Ran Into**
During the course of the 36 hour hackathon, we ran into many expected and unexpected problems. Since we decided to use a variety of tools, technologies, and frameworks, problems arose frequently. One of the biggest challenges we faced was the implementation of MATLAB with our backend and frontend as there were numerous APIs we had to cycle through. Having to struggle with Auth0 and Adobe Express Add On documentation definitely took time and effort to figure out but eventually with time and perseverance, we were able to accomplish what we envisioned with these technologies. 

## **Accomplishments That We're Proud Of**
With our successfully completed program, we are proud to have used a large variety of technologies that will each enhance our platform's functionality. Our team strived for ambition, integrating a multitude of tools and systems which also contributed greatly in our mission of bridging the financial literacy gap in our society. Knowing the difficulty of completing certain types of projects, it was a significant achievement as we effectively collaborated by sharing our skills, experience and knowledge which all combined all the elements into one cohesive and functional platform.

## **What We Learned**
Once again, the highlight of our teamwork is our collaboration and seemingly mind-reading understanding of one-another. Over the course of the project and seeing the huge pile of work with technology we have not used before, we had to learn to work with each other quickly. With our team set up to have collective leadership, we were able to constantly remain on the same page for the entire duration as if we shared the same mind. This allowed us to seamlessly swap tasks and roles in milliseconds to give another teammate a break or find a more efficient way to tackle our hurdles.

## **What's Next for Diversifile**
At Diversifile's current state, we believe it perfectly demonstrates the solution when catering our services toward novice users starting their journey in investment. However, our idea fundamentally was inclusivity, meaning we intend to also allow for more advanced users to also enjoy the perks of our website. To cater towards the more advanced users, we plan to implement even more candlestick patterns and even include an easy-access method to SEC filings. Finally, an addition of a financial literacy assistant chatbot will be a benefit to all users as it provides answers and support to queries big and small.
